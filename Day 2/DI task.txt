EF Core - More realistic - with DI and later we will see adding more features to the app
1. Create a new database - BankingDB
2. Add 2 tables - which are related to each other with primary key and foreign key

	BranchInfo - BranchNo (Primary key) -  add 5 records
		     BranchName  
		     BranchCity 
	AccountsInfo -  AccountNo(Primary key) - add 5 records
		        AccountName
			AccountType
			AccountBalance
			AccountIsActive
			 AccountBranch (Foreign Key)

		This are the related tables
3. Create a new WebAPI project and enable entity framework, download poco classes and create 2 controllers
4. configure DI 
5. test the project
-----------------------------------------------------
1.	we will want to add 1 more column to AccountsInfo table in a database - 
		want to change datatype of AccountBalance from int to bigint
	
	will my application still work ???? if not what to do

		Want to add 1 more table to database TransactionInfo
