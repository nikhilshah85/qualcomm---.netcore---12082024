			This is the WebAPI, you developed and you are sharing the data to 
				--clients
				--customer
				--other applications technologies (front end like MVC, React, Angular etc)
				-- making data available to data scientist, data engineers, analyst 


	on the other hand, if data is shared with you in the API format, how will you consume it in frontend ?


	To consume the API - there are 2 ways - 2 approach (your expertise will be to choose the right one - 								codeing is 8-10 lines in both approach


		1. Client Side Calls
			This is the fastest way to display the data, less secured, not to be used for
			sensitive data calls like Logins, Credits cars, statements, transfer etc.

			we use fetch api - which is a standard built into all the browser and web apps
			
		2. Server Side calls
			This is little bit slower than the above 1 but safest 
			we use HttpClient class which is a programming approach for every programming lang
			C#, Python, Java, Angular, Typescript, React etc....
			this can also be used in console app, desktop apps, libraries etc, where as 1st one 			is only used for webapps
