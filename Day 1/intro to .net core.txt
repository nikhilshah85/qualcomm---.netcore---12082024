	A new project with 10 developers on .Net framework
	You need and organization needs to invest on below

	1. Windows OS - investment 
	2. Visual Studio - licence
	3. Production - Windows Server (very costly)
---
	Why not use Java ?, node, Angular -- which will be completely free 
	
	4.Additionally you have Cloud, .net framework not designed for all the cloud

	5. Lots of new principles, design patterns, code practices came up which was not followed by 			framework
			Design principles
			ORM 
			Dependency Injection 
			JSON based REST API services - no present 

		and thus they completely rewrote the framework from scratch - and made it free with tools
			complete support for cloud

		Develop anywhere, Run Anywhere
		--Complete opensource
		--VS Code - Visual Studio Code - free for all the OS

	also has CLI support - to create, develop, build, run and deploy the apps


		Lets us create first app using VS code

		1. dotnet --version
		2. dotnet new typeofapp --name firstApp
				console
				WebAPI
