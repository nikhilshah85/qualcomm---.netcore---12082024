				For data exchange on cross platforms, cross technology, cross apps
		

	1. We had SOA architecture - Web Service - Advance Web service - in .net we called it as WCF app's 
		Communication was SOAP messages - XML based heavy message
		This was more of Meta data - than data

		eg. temp exchange - 
		get me temperature for Blr
			it should return 30

		instead it will return

			<city:string> Bangalore </city:string>
			<temperature:int>30</temperature:30>
			...
			...
				...
			more info

		Thus this was very slow

	2. Web Services did not follow much of HTTP protocol standards

	3. Lenghty for development as well for consumption
	4. used to be proxy based - thus a lot of dependency
		Thus a more better way of communication was needed


		So to solve above problem and challenges W3C and ECMA came up with a new standards
			called REST

			1. Representational State Transfer - which transfers state of data only - not the 					metadata
			
			2. Not proxy based 
			
			3. Based on JSON data exchange format
			
	Microsoft took this standards - created a framework based on it -(namespace, classes, methods, attributes, props etc...) and named it as WebAPI - runs on .net core 

		while developing we will follow all the REST standards


---------------------------------------------
	For testing API there are tools which are used called
		Postman
		Fiddler
		Certain extentions on browser

		but since .net core 5.0 Microsoft has included - swagger

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	A WebAPI developer does 2 things -
	1. Develope WebAPI - so that others can consume it
	2. Consume WebAPI - developed by other


-------
	1. Develope WebAPI - so that others can consume it
		you create methods running web and following Http Procols verbs

		create web methods for 
			GET - when user wants to get the data
			PUT - when user want to edit/update the data
			POST - when user wants to add/create the new data 
			DELETE - when user wants to delete the data
		
		data is termed as a resource in WebAPI 

	end users/clients/customers/applications will communicate for above methods and you will
		send Response with 2 things data and StatusCode
