			When we had WebAPI yesterday, we had couple of URL


		/accounts/list
		/accounts/list/savings
		/accounts/total
		/accounts/sortbytype
		

		/branches/city/Mumbai
		/branches/branchname/manyatatech
		/branches/branch/10

	so like wise api application will have 100's of such urls

	we we will not want everyurl to be accessible by everyone, everyapplication etc..
		That is why, when you have a WebAPI application, no one can access the data from it
			
		Thus we have to configure something called as CORS
		Cross Origin Resource Shareing
			we will decide which application gets access to accounts, 
			who can perform insert, or update or delete or all of them 
			Who can get only branches but not accounts
		so we create cors policies, done by developers for the same
