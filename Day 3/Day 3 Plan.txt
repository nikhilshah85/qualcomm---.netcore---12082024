Day 3:
	1. Server side api calls - HttpClient
	2. CORS - security feature
	3. Authentication in WebAPI
	3. JWT - Json Web Token - implementation for security for authentication
	4. oAuth security in MVC application 
	5. Post test
	6. Feedback

	As a developer, you need to 
		1. develop WebAPI 
		2. Consume WebAPI


		We used Fetch API - for client side consumption
			This is fastest a little bit less secure 

		We Will use HttpClient - for Server side 	
			This is the safest


	-------------------
	Let us see how is Fetch API not so safe
	Task : Create a new Applicaiton in day 3 folder - MVC application
		Make a call to below url - useing fetch api 
		
		https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/comments

		We should not be useing for scencetive data
		Because the complete code written by developer gets disclosed on browser
		
	Let us now make calls which are safer useing HttpClient class
			HttpClient is a part of standard and is available in every technology
		It can also be used for Destkop apps, console apps, libraries etc...



		1. create a new project - MVC
		2. We need to create a new Model Class - class which will have properties of incoming 				data
